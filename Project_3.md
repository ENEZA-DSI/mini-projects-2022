# Role of sylvatic transmission in the AAT of livestock in Shimba Hills. 
 
## Background of the study. 
Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a fatal livestock disease across Africa, caused by trypanosomes (Trypanosoma) and transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina). Even though wild animals are generally resistant to clinical trypanosomiasis, asymptomatic trypanosome infections are frequent in wildlife and have long been thought to represent a substantial potential reservoir for AAT in livestock. Such sylvatic transmission is crucial in AAT epidemiology, but this has never been confirmed. This project aims to investigate the role of sylvatic transmission in the AAT of livestock by quantifying wildlife-to-livestock transmission in Shimba Hills National Reserve using the flies collected within and outside the park as a proxy. Whole-genome sequence data from 34 Trypanosoma congolense isolated from host blood (livestock) and 81 from tsetse flies are available for this study. 

## Objectives 
1. Develop a bioinformatics workflow to: 
2. Perform genome assembly and identify the fly hosts 
3. Filter out host and vector reads and call the variants  
4. Determine Genetic diversity of T.congolense in Shimba Hills. 
## Question to be answered: 
1. Are there genetic differences between trypanosome strains in wild and domestic animals?
