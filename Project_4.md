# Data mining to understand the adoption of Data Science for Health in Kenya
This mini-project will use data mining techniques to fetch published research articles about Kenya and Africa. Including one of two global North data for comparison might also be helpful. This will entail fetching data from news articles and social media and seeking to understand the sentiments of the people when it comes to adopting data science for health in Kenya. From the data mining, visualization, and NLP, explore some of the following questions:
a) What are the gaps in communication, understanding, and legislation?
b) Which areas in health have the most attention with the potential to apply machine learning and AI?
