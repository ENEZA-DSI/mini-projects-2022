# Data mining to understand the adoption of Data Science for Health in Kenya
In this mini-project, you will use data mining techniques to gather published research articles about Kenya and Africa. You may also include data from the global North for comparison. This will also involve collecting data from news articles and social media to understand public sentiments regarding the adoption of data science for health in Kenya. Through data mining, visualization, and natural language processing (NLP), explore the following questions:
1. What are the communication, understanding, and legislative gaps?
2. In which areas of health is there significant attention with potential for applying machine learning and AI?
