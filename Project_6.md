# Biological age prediction using routine laboratory test results in a cohort of healthy adults in sub-Saharan Africa

The date of birth typically defines a person's age yet increasing evidence suggests that the ageing process varies widely among individuals.  Therefore, strictly speaking, age can be chronological (based on date of birth) or biological (based on changes in the biological function of an individual). Biological age is emerging as an important measure of the overall health of a person and is associated with the risk of age-related diseases, including specific cancers and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.  To date, several measures of biological age have been developed that either use epigenetic information derived from a person's genome sequence, clinical biomarkers or both. Computational models for predicting biological ageing have been predominantly developed using data from European populations. The performance of the existing biological age prediction models in African populations is unknown. In addition, there is a need to create accessible biological age prediction models that are optimized for biological information of African populations, especially given their extensive genetic diversity and variations in baseline laboratory values. Therefore, this project will: 

i) Evaluate the ability of crucial existing biological age prediction tools using clinical biomarker data from European population (UK Biobank and US reference population) using data from a healthy African cohort 
ii) Train and evaluate new machine learning models for biological age prediction using laboratory test data from a cohort of healthy adults in sub-Saharan Africa
iii) Determine relationships between chronological and predicted biological age in the healthy African cohort

## Datasets & other resources
Laboratory data from a cohort of >500 healthy individuals in sub-Saharan Africa
Pre-existing biological age prediction models trained using laboratory data of cohorts from North America and Europe
## Expected outcomes
1. First biological age prediction study evaluating the performance of clinical biomarker-based biological age prediction models based on data in predominantly European populations
2. Identification of potential differences in biological age prediction between European and African populations
3. Identification of potential disparities in biological age prediction in European vs. African populations
